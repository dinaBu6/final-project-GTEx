*First Part*
R script.
Matched to the first and second steps as described in the PDF file of the project.

*Second Part*
R script.
Matched to the third step as described in the PDF file of the project.
The scripts show the options we explored. 
Ultimately we decided to go with the order presented in "stage2_quantRegFix".


*Third Part*
Python script.
Matched to the fourth, fifth and sixth steps as described in the PDF file of the project.

You have to run different code lines depending on the method you choose:

1) Without feature selection: 
	skip the chunks - 
	########### Feature selection with SelectPercentile ##########
	////// Feature selection with logistic regression /////////
	!!!!!!! Feature selection by using the feature importance !!!!!!!!!
	### for Precentile feature selection

2) With Feature selection using SelectPercentile:
	skip the chunks - 
	////// Feature selection with logistic regression /////////
	##########DO NOT RUN FOR SELECT PERCENTILE#############
	!!!!!!! Feature selection by using the feature importance !!!!!!!!!
	### for 13,000 + logistic featere selection

3) With Feature selection using logistic regression: 
	skip the chunks - 
	########### Feature selection with SelectPercentile ##########
	!!!!!!! Feature selection by using the feature importance !!!!!!!!!
	### for Precentile feature selection
 
4) Feature selection using feature importance: 
	skip the chunks - 
	########### Feature selection with SelectPercentile ##########
	////// Feature selection with logistic regression /////////
	### for Precentile feature selection
